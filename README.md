  ## Description

  ## Installation
  No need to install, you can directly visit the site [here](https://vast-reaches-27780-fa2d1eebad1b.herokuapp.com/). If you would like to get access to the code, clone or fork the repository from [github](https://github.com/uwlryoung/blog-site). 

  ## Usage
  There are three parts of the website: 
  1) Home
  2) Dashboard
  3) Login/Logout
  
  Home - This is where you will find all of the posts that have been created by all users. You don't need to be logged in to view these.

  Dashboard - This is where you can access the posts that you have made as well as create posts and delete posts. You must be logged in to view the dashboard. If you aren't, clicking Dashboard will redirect you to the login screen.

  - Clicking on "Read More" in either home or your dashboard will bring you to the individual post view where users can leave comments.

  Login/Logout - This is how you login and logout. If you do not yet have a username, click on "Login" and then click on the button "Sign-up Instead". Then fill in the form to make a new user account.
